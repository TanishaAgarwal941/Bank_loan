# Bank Loan Analysis Project  

## Overview  
In this project, **SQL, Excel, and Tableau** are used to analyze and visualize data from bank loan applications. The same analysis is repeated across all three tools, including crucial calculations and dashboards, demonstrating how each handles **data processing, computation, and visualization** differently.  

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL**: Data extraction and aggregation through queries.  
- **Excel**: Data manipulation and visualization using built-in functions, pivot tables, and charts.  
- **Tableau & PowerBI**: Creation of interactive visualizations and dynamic dashboards.  

## Key Metrics & Calculations  
This analysis focuses on the following key metrics, consistently calculated across SQL, Excel, and Tableau:  
- **Loan Applications (Total & MoM)** – Tracks the number of applications and their trends over time.  
- **Funded & Received Amounts** – Compares the requested loan amounts vs. the funded amounts.  
- **Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Ratio** – Evaluates affordability and financial health of applicants.  
- **Good vs. Bad Loans** – Classifies loans as **"Good"** (paid off or current) and **"Bad"** (delinquent or defaulted) based on loan status.  

## Dashboards  
The following dashboards provide **visual insights** into the loan data. They have been created and replicated in both Excel and Tableau:

### 1. Summary Dashboard  
Displays high-level KPIs, trends, and comparisons of loan data.

### 2. Overview Dashboard  
Tracks monthly trends, regional analysis, and loan terms.

### 3. Details Dashboard  
Focuses on individual loan records and status breakdowns.

## Conclusion  
This project provides a **comprehensive analysis of bank loans**, helping banks make better financial decisions, reduce risk, and improve lending practices.  

By implementing the same analysis across **SQL, Excel, and Tableau**, we were able to:  
✔ **Extract and process data efficiently** (**SQL**)  
✔ **Perform detailed calculations and analysis** (**Excel**)  
✔ **Create dynamic and interactive visualizations** (**Tableau & PowerBI**)  

This project offers **valuable insights** into the performance and trends of loan applications while showcasing the strengths of each tool in **data processing, analysis, and visualization**.
